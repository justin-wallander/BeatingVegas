# Beating Vegas



## NBA Game Total Prediction
### Goals: 
* Create a Regression Model using historical NBA data to predict NBA Game total points scored. 

* Using Vegas closing line for O/U, the goal is to build a model that predicts more accurately than Vegasâ€™ lines.

* Given my intuition on what stats might impact game totals, see if there are any stats that are surprising

* Data Soureces: NBA API, NBA.COM, BASKETBALL-REFERENCE.COM, https://www.sportsbookreviewsonline.com/scoresoddsarchives/nba/nbaoddsarchives.htm

### Challenges:
* Given that I do not have a time machine, I have to be very cognizant of what information I will have available to me at any given time
* Figuring out the test-train-split in order to avoid any potential info leakage

### Data Pipeline/Feature Engineering:

* First I had to gather all the individual game stats from the API and get it into a dataframe

* Once the data was in the data frame, I needed to combine home team and away teams on a single row. Fortunately the API provided a function to do that for me

* Once I had all the data on a single row I had to figure out what I wanted to do with it. Do I want to have a rolling average dating back maybe 10 or 20 games, or do I want to just use the season averages?

* Ultimately I decdided to go with the season averages in the final model. Figuring out how to average the info provided not be very difficult, I was able to create this function for it. It was very slow to run though, I am not sure if there are better methods to accomplish this task but will be tinkering with it more to find out: 
```python
def running_col_avg(df, year, team):
    df1 = df[(df.SEASON_ID == year)&(df.TEAM_ABBREVIATION_A == team)]
    df1= df1.reset_index(drop = True)
    df1.columns = ['SEASON_ID','TEAM_ID','TEAM_ABBREVIATION','TEAM_NAME',
                      'GAME_ID','GAME_DATE','MATCHUP','WL','MIN','PTS','FGM',
                      'FGA','FG_PCT','FG3M','FG3A','FG3_PCT','FTM','FTA',
                      'FT_PCT','OREB','DREB','REB','AST','STL','BLK','TOV',
                      'PF','PLUS_MINUS','TEAM_ID_OPP','TEAM_ABBREVIATION_OPP',
                      'TEAM_NAME_OPP','MATCHUP_OPP','WL_OPP','MIN_OPP','PTS_OPP',
                      'FGM_OPP','FGA_OPP','FG_PCT_OPP','FG3M_OPP','FG3A_OPP',
                      'FG3_PCT_OPP','FTM_OPP','FTA_OPP','FT_PCT_OPP','OREB_OPP',
                      'DREB_OPP','REB_OPP','AST_OPP','STL_OPP','BLK_OPP','TOV_OPP',
                      'PF_OPP','PLUS_MINUS_OPP', 'TEAM_TEST', 'TEST_OPP','ML_A',
                      'ML_B', 'TOTAL_OPEN', 'TOTAL_CLOSE', 'PTS_SPR_OPEN', 'PTS_SPR_CLOSE']

    avg_cols = ['WL','PTS','FGM',
                'FGA','FG_PCT','FG3M','FG3A','FG3_PCT','FTM','FTA',
                'FT_PCT','OREB','DREB','REB','AST','STL','BLK','TOV',
                'PF','PLUS_MINUS','PTS_OPP', 'FGM_OPP','FGA_OPP','FG_PCT_OPP',
                'FG3M_OPP','FG3A_OPP','FG3_PCT_OPP','FTM_OPP','FTA_OPP',
                'FT_PCT_OPP','OREB_OPP','DREB_OPP','REB_OPP','AST_OPP',
                'STL_OPP','BLK_OPP','TOV_OPP','PF_OPP']

    df1['WL']= df1['WL'].map({'W': 1, 'L' :0})
    df1['WL_OPP']=df1['WL_OPP'].map({'W': 1, 'L' :0})
    df1['GP'] = df1.index
    df1['GAME_TOTAL'] = df1['PTS'] + df1['PTS_OPP']

    df1[avg_cols] = df1[avg_cols].astype(float)
    counter = 1
    for idx in range(len(df1)):
        if counter != len(df1):
            df1.loc[counter, avg_cols] += df1.loc[idx, avg_cols]
            counter+=1
        df1.loc[idx, avg_cols] /= (idx +1)
    return df1
```

* Once I had the averages for each team's offensive and defensive stats, I took the odds dataframe I created and combined it with the averages dataframe. Then I recombine the teams again to have a final row that included the home teams offensive and defensive stats and the away teams offensive and defensive stats, as well as the odds for the O/U open and close as well as the open and close of the points spread.

* The next order of business was to insure that I was not using any information I would not have at the time of the prediction. I took out the points spread close and the O/U close. I also had to figure out how to shift the averages down 1 row while keeping everything else the same. This was to avoid the fact that if I did not do it, I would be using stats that occurred in the game in the average in order to predict that game. Fortunately I was able to figure out a some code to do this fairyly quickly: 
```python
same_list=['SEASON_ID','TEAM_ID','TEAM_ABBREVIATION','TEAM_NAME','GAME_ID','GAME_DATE',
        'MATCHUP','TEAM_TEST','TEST_OPP','ML_A','ML_B','TOTAL_OPEN','TOTAL_CLOSE',
        'PTS_SPR_OPEN','PTS_SPR_CLOSE','GP','GAME_TOTAL']


change_list= ['WL','MIN','PTS','FGM','FGA','FG_PCT','FG3M','FG3A','FG3_PCT','FTM','FTA',
	        'FT_PCT','OREB','DREB','REB','AST','STL','BLK','TOV','PF','PLUS_MINUS',	
            'TEAM_ID_OPP','TEAM_ABBREVIATION_OPP','TEAM_NAME_OPP','MATCHUP_OPP', 'WL_OPP',
            'MIN_OPP','PTS_OPP','FGM_OPP','FGA_OPP','FG_PCT_OPP','FG3M_OPP','FG3A_OPP',	
            'FG3_PCT_OPP','FTM_OPP','FTA_OPP','FT_PCT_OPP','OREB_OPP','DREB_OPP','REB_OPP',
            'AST_OPP','STL_OPP','BLK_OPP','TOV_OPP','PF_OPP','PLUS_MINUS_OPP']

avg_season.sort_values('GAME_ID', inplace= True)
avg_10.sort_values('GAME_ID', inplace= True)

shift_season_df = pd.DataFrame(columns=avg_season.columns)
for year in season_id_list:
    for team in team_abbrev_list:
        t_df = pd.DataFrame(columns=avg_season.columns)
        t_df[same_list] = avg_season[(avg_season.SEASON_ID == year) & (
                                      avg_season.TEAM_ABBREVIATION == team)][same_list]
        t_df[change_list] = avg_season[(avg_season.SEASON_ID == year) & (
                            avg_season.TEAM_ABBREVIATION == team)][change_list].shift(periods=1)
        t_df.dropna(inplace=True)
        shift_season_df = pd.concat([shift_season_df, t_df], ignore_index=True)
```
