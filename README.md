Proposals for Capstone 2 project


## Proposal 1:

### NBA Game Total Prediction
* I am very interested in building a model to predict the total for an NBA Game based on team stats. Another top priority, obtain inferences from the data into what stats potentially impact totals the most. 

* I plan on using various regression models in order to predict the totals. Linear regression, random forests, gradient boosting will most likely be my entry points

* Given the interest in basketball and sports betting, this certainly would have some benefit to people if a good model can be built. I think initially I would either just have a very plain website where the prediction are posted, but making a more handy and user-friendly web app would be ideal. Particularly if I could incorporate other leagues and predictions. 

* Data Soureces: NBA API, NBA.COM, BASKETBALL-REFERENCE.COM


## Proposal 2:

### Commute Traffic Prediction
* Given a particular route, I would like to build a model that would predict the probability you will face traffic on that route and predict the amount of delay time. 

* I believe EDA will be the determining factor in how I would approach this problem. For instances, I am not sure if there is data for delays or not, but I know there are 24 hour flow rates, so I would  try to potentially convert that to expected waiting time. I believe for this problem, I would want to use a combination of classification and regression. Classification for the probability of traffic, regression for predicting the delay if so. 

* With all the map and traffic apps available, this might not be particularly novel or useful given it's being done at a high rate. Regardless, I have always had a curiousity about traffic, what causes it, what can be done to fix it, etc. So while it might be the shallow end, I just want to get in and play around with modeling traffic data. 

* Data Soureces: I plan on focusing locally to Austin and Texas so my data sources will be:

## Proposal 3:

### Freight Market Rate Prediction
* This ties in directly to my previous career. The freight market is wild. Intuitively, it's possible to build some decent heuristics over the years to get a feel for it, but it is very difficult to get a grasp of what is really driving the market. I would like to build a model that would be able to predict the Rate per Mile in a given Market for a given day or week. More importantly though, I will be using the inferrential aspects of the models to gain insights into what potentially are drivers of market volatility.  

* I plan on using various regression models in order to predict the totals. Linear regression, random forests, gradient boosting will most likely be my entry points

* From trucking companies and freight brokers to customers and shipppers/receivers, understanding and being able to forecast market conditions are critical from operating profitably. Even if the predictions of a model aren't very good, being able to get some inferences and talk compentently about them is enough to give a decent sized competitive advantage, particularly on the sales side when negotiating contracts and rates. 

* Data Soureces: Unfortunately this is where I am stuck. There are some pay options. I believe webscraping would be necessary, scraping sites like DAT.COM and FREIGHTWAVES.com. Given my contacts in the industry, I might be able to get some propietary data as well.
